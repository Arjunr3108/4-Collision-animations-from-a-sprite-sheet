Live Demo at "https://arjunr3108.github.io/4-Collision-animations-from-a-sprite-sheet/".

This is a demo of Collision Animations.

It uses a mouse event (click), plays a sound, and rotates the animation in a random way.

The main one in the live pages is the click to animate and play sound, One containing the basics of collision detection between rectangle scripts, And the other containing the basics of collision detection between circle scripts.

This website was done with the help of the tutorial from the FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel's "JavaScript Game Development Course for Beginners."
